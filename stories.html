            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Semblance was born not in a lab, but in a moment of frustration. Surrounded by overly complex tech and
                noisy design, we asked a simple question — <em>what if intelligence could be invisible?</em>
            </p>

            <h3>In the Beginning</h3>
            <p>
                We started as a small team of engineers and designers in a Mumbai co-working space — united by a belief
                that technology should support, not distract. Our first prototype? A bracelet that tracked your heart
                without lighting up like a disco.

            <h3>The Philosophy Behind the Form</h3>
            <p>
                Semblance means “appearance” — but for us, it means intentionality. Every edge, every curve, every
                interaction is designed to be effortless, invisible, and natural. Because we believe the best tech
                doesn’t
                demand your attention — it enhances your presence.
            </p>

            <h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
            <p>
                From that first prototype, we’ve grown into a brand trusted by thinkers, creators, and quiet leaders.
                Semblance One and Semblance Chrono are just the beginning. Our mission continues — to design wearables
                for
                people who don’t want to wear technology, but want to live smarter.
